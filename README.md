# Xiao et al - stimuli and behavior analysis code
Stytra stimuli and analysis notebooks for the submitted publication _Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells Sculpt the Visual System by Regulating Axonal Remodeling_, Xiao et al, 2020.

## Stytra stimulation protocols
The following experiment scripts were used to run experiments with `stytra==0.8.26`:
 - `trackingfish_nostim_exp.py`: script for running the no stimulation, freely swimming larvae experiments reported in Fig.2 and Fig.S3.
 - `trackingfish_nostim_exp.py`: script for running the curve of contrast for the OMR response in embedded fish reported in Fig.2 and Fig.S3.
 
 ## Behavior data analysis:
 - `Freely swimming analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the no stimulation, freely swimming larvae experiments reported in Fig.2 and Fig.S3.
 - `OMR - visual acuity random gratings.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the curve of contrast for the OMR response in embedded fish reported in Fig.2 and Fig.S3.
